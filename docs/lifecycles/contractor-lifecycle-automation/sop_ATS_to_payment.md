## 🔹 3. **Procedure Overview**

### 🟩 **Step 1: Candidate Placement**

* **Trigger:** Webhook from CATSone on candidate placement
* **Action:** Webhook handler validates and logs event
* **Best Practice:** Ensure webhook payloads are idempotent and logged in Control Tower (CT1)

---

### 🟦 **Step 2: Contract Generation & Signing**

* **Action:** Create Firestore records for contractor and contract
* **Sub-process:**

  * Generate contract via Document Generator
  * Initiate E-signature request
  * Store signed PDF in secure storage
  * Create Contractor Portal Account
* **Best Practice:** All documents should include version control, signature timestamp, and be immutable post-signing

---

### 🟨 **Step 3: Timesheet/Invoice Submission**

* **Action:** Contractor submits via portal
* **Data Stored:** Firestore stores submissions + uploads
* **Best Practice:** Validate formats/schema before allowing submission; emit `Control Tower` log for each submission

---

### 🟧 **Step 4: Approval & Invoice Generation**

* **Review:** Desktop Manager approves or rejects records
* **Output:**

  * Approved records → Invoice Generator
  * Generate PDF/CSV invoices + push to Accounts System
* **Best Practice:** Approvals should follow a **2-step review** if invoice > threshold (e.g., $10,000)

---

### 🟥 **Step 5: Payment Processing**

* **Process:** Accounts System sends payment info → Payment Poller executes transfer
* **Best Practice:** Monitor failed payments or delays via Control Tower; retry logic should be in place

---

### 🔍 **Step 6: Observability (Control Tower)**

* **Logged Events:**

  * ATS webhook received
  * Contract generated/signed
  * Submission received
  * Record approved
  * Invoice issued
  * Payment completed
* **Best Practice:** Alerts should trigger on:

  * Missing documents
  * Delayed approvals > 3 days
  * Payment delays > 24 hours

---

## 🔹 4. **Security & Compliance**

| Item                      | Practice                                             |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔐 **Data Security**      | Encrypt Firestore, use IAM roles, secure signed PDFs |
| ✅ **Audit Logs**          | All steps must be time-stamped and recorded          |
| 🧾 **Legal Compliance**   | Signed contracts stored for 7+ years                 |
| 🔄 **Retention Policies** | Submissions retained per company data policy         |

## 🔹 5. **Error Handling & Recovery**

| Scenario               | Response                           |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| ❌ Webhook failure      | Retry w/ backoff; log in CT        |
| ❌ Signature rejected   | Notify HR; escalate to legal       |
| ❌ Invoice format error | Mark invalid; contractor notified  |
| ❌ Payment failure      | Retry + CT alert + flag contractor |

## 🔹 6. **Roles & Responsibilities**

## 🔹 8. **Review & Maintenance**

* This SOP must be reviewed **quarterly** or after any major system change.
