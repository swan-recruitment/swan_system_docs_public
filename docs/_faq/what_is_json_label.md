Good call to ask 👍 — let me explain what a **labels.json** would actually do for you.

## 📌 What a `labels.json` File Is

It’s a **JSON configuration file** that lists all the GitHub issue labels you want to use in your repo. Each entry defines:

* **name** (the label itself, e.g. `"phase-3"`)
* **color** (hex code for the label color)
* **description** (so others know what it’s for)

Example snippet:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "phase-3",
    "color": "1d76db",
    "description": "Phase 3 – Desktop App + Excel Migration"
  },
  {
    "name": "work-order",
    "color": "f9d0c4",
    "description": "Tracks Work Orders"
  }
]
```

## ⚙️ What It Does in GitHub

* You can **bulk import all labels** at once instead of creating them one by one in the web UI.
* Tools like [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) or [Probot Settings App](https://probot.github.io/apps/settings/) can read this file and sync your repo’s labels automatically.
* Ensures **consistency** across repos (e.g., `swan_system_docs`, `swan-firebase-backend`, etc. all get the same labels).
* Makes onboarding easier → contributors see the same label taxonomy everywhere.

## 🎯 Why It Helps You

You’ve already defined a **label taxonomy** in CONTRIBUTING.md:

* **Phase** (phase-1-2 … phase-8)
* **Type** (work-order, design-spec, diagram, plan, governance)
* **Status** (draft, in-progress, blocked, needs-review, approved, deferred)
* **Priority** (p1, p2, p3)
* **Area** (backend, desktop, portal, website, finance, control-tower)

Instead of manually creating ~30+ labels in each repo, you’d have them pre-seeded. This avoids typos (like `phase3` vs `phase-3`) and guarantees automation (like your Phase Issue Templates) works immediately.

👉 Do you want me to **generate a full labels.json** with your taxonomy (including suggested colors and descriptions), so you can import it straight into your repos?
