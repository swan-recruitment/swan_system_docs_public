## ‚öôÔ∏è How

- **How to install Codex CLI (inside WSL/Ubuntu):**
  ```bash
  sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
  sudo apt install -y nodejs npm git
  npm install -g @openai/codex
  codex signin
  ```

- **How to run Codex:**
  1. Open Ubuntu (via WSL).
  2. `cd` into a repo root, e.g.:
     ```bash
     cd /mnt/c/Users/Ben/swan-erp-system/swan_system_docs
     ```
  3. Switch to coding model:
     ```bash
     codex /model gpt-5-codex
     ```
  4. Run prompts like:
     ```bash
     codex "Scan all docs and generate a Markdown index grouped by ERP module."
     ```

- **How to keep safe:**
  - Work in **approval mode** (default): Codex asks before edits/commands.
  - Always create a new branch before Codex tasks:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b codex-task-1
    ```
  - Review Codex‚Äôs proposed diffs with:
    ```bash
    git diff
    ```

## üí° Why

- **Why use Codex?**
  - üöÄ **Speed:** automates repetitive tasks (scans, cleanups, edits).  
  - üìö **Consistency:** enforces uniform naming, docs, workflows across repos.  
  - üîé **Insight:** quickly summarizes, documents, or proposes changes.  

- **Why WSL?**  
  Codex CLI is tested on Linux/macOS. Windows support is experimental. WSL gives a stable Linux environment inside Windows.

---

## üìç Where

- **Where does Codex run?**
  - **Locally (CLI):** inside WSL/Ubuntu, scoped to a repo folder.  
  - **In VS Code:** via the Codex extension, inline with your editor.  
  - **In the Cloud:** at chatgpt.com/codex, integrated with GitHub.

- **Where are the repos?**  
  Under:  
  ```
  C:\Users\Ben\swan-erp-system\
  ```
  Each subfolder (e.g. `swan-firebase-backend`, `swan_system_docs`) is its own repo.

---

## üïë When

- **When to use CLI:**  
  For quick local scans, tests, or repo-wide consistency checks.

- **When to use VS Code extension:**  
  While actively editing code or docs; apply Codex diffs inline.

- **When to use Cloud Agent:**  
  For heavy tasks (full builds, running test suites, PR automation).

- **When not to use Codex:**  
  - If your repo has uncommitted changes (Codex works best on clean states).  
  - If you don‚Äôt want automated edits (use read-only planning mode instead).

---

## üîí Safety Notes

- Codex runs sandboxed. By default:
  - No network access
  - Writes limited to repo root
- You can tighten or loosen permissions with `approval`, `read-only`, or `full access` modes.
- Always review diffs (`git diff` or GitHub PR) before merging.
- Business/Enterprise plans disable training on your data by default.
