# Workflow SOPs
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-28 21:23 BST

This family covers the breakdown and analysis of business processes at the **step level**.  
It provides a structured way to capture actions, data flows, roles, risks, KPIs, exceptions, and visual maps.

## ðŸ“‘ Dimensions
 
- Workflow SOP (Process dimension):          What happens? Whatâ€™s the sequence of actions?
- Data Flow SOP (Information dimension):     What data moves in/out? How is it transformed or validated?
- RACI SOP (People dimension):               Who is Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed?
- Risk & Control SOP (Risk dimension):       What could go wrong and how do we mitigate?
- Metrics & KPI SOP (Performance dimension): How do we measure success?
- Exceptions SOP (Variation dimension):      What about edge cases and alternative flows?
- Visual Map SOP (Visual dimension):         How does the flow look graphically?
