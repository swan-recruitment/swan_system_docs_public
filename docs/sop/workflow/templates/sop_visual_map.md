# SOP Template: Visual Process Map

## Purpose
Provide a diagram or visual map of the workflow step or process.  
Use this to give a clear, high-level view of how actions, data, and decisions connect.  

---

## Recommended Standards

- **Default (Current Phase): Simple Flowcharts**  
  - Best for early-stage documentation.  
  - Easy to create in tools like Miro, Lucidchart, draw.io, or even PowerPoint.  
  - Shapes: Start/End, Process, Decision, Connector.  

- **Future Standard (Long-Term): BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation)**  
  - Use when workflows stabilize and automation is considered.  
  - Provides consistent symbols for events, tasks, gateways, and flows.  
  - Can integrate with workflow engines and process automation tools.  

*Tip: Always save diagrams in a standard format (e.g., PNG + source file in `.drawio` or `.bpmn`). Store them in `/docs/diagrams/`.*
