Here’s a **content-level review** of the three key files from your `swan_system_docs` repo:

---

## 📅 `phase_plans_index.md`

**Purpose:**
Acts as the **master index** for all Swan project phases, beyond just listing them. It integrates **objectives, dependencies, entry/exit criteria, risks/mitigations, KPIs, and linked visuals/specs**. The document is positioned as a **“single pane of glass”** for planning and delivery tracking.

**Highlights:**

* Uses clear **status keys** 🟡 Drafted · 🟦 In Progress · ✅ Approved · ⏸ Deferred.
* Phase 1–2: “Foundations + Backend Core” links directly to supporting plans (`phase_1_2_plan.md`) and visuals (`swan_erp_flow_diagram.md`, `swan_erp_erd.md`).
* Each phase ties to **work orders**, ensuring tactical execution is traceable.

**Strength:** Creates strong **traceability** across phases, visuals, and subsystem work orders.
**Gap:** Would benefit from **cross-phase risk tracking** (e.g., issues in Phase 2 that delay Phase 3).

## 🗂️ `work_order_master.md`

**Purpose:**
Defined as the **canonical master work order** for the entire ERP build. Unlike individual subsystem work orders, this doc blends a **narrative view** (big picture scope/governance) with **checklist-style execution items**, making it the **authoritative source of delivery planning**.

**Highlights:**

* Covers **all phases, subsystems, and governance tasks**.
* Establishes **structure + hierarchy** of work orders.
* Acts as the “glue” between the granular subsystem work orders and the high-level project phases.

**Strength:** Provides **single authoritative reference** → no ambiguity about where the “real” work order lives.
**Gap:** Doesn’t yet show **current status or owners per subsystem** (e.g., Firebase backend in progress vs. Control Tower drafted). This could be solved by tagging or tables.

---

## 🏗️ `swan_erp_system_architecture.md`

**Purpose:**
Defines the **overall architecture** of the Swan ERP system. Establishes why the ERP exists (unify operations for a lean recruitment firm) and what it integrates.

**Highlights:**

* Clear overview of Swan Recruitment’s context (UK-based, energy sector, 35+ years, 4-person core team).
* ERP scope: **candidate sourcing, contract generation, contractor management, finance, reporting** — all unified into one system.
* Focused on **integration** rather than isolated tooling.

**Strength:** Sets a strong **vision + rationale** for the ERP project.
**Gap:** Doesn’t yet expose a **modular component diagram** here — likely deferred to `diagrams/erp-module-map/`. Could add inline **links to visuals**.

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

* **phase_plans_index.md** → Single source of truth for project roadmap.
* **work_order_master.md** → Canonical “work order of work orders,” tying execution to planning.
* **swan_erp_system_architecture.md** → High-level vision doc that grounds the ERP in Swan’s business reality.

Together, they form a **three-layer documentation hierarchy**:

1. **Architecture doc** (vision/system scope).
2. **Phase index** (strategic roadmap with dependencies).
3. **Master work order** (execution and governance).

👉 Do you want me to **drill into one of the subsystem work orders** (e.g., `work_order_firebase_backend.md` or `work_order_control_tower.md`) next, so we can check how detailed and actionable those are compared to the master doc?
