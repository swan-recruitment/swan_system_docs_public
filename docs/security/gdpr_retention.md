# GDPR & Data Retention Policy

## Purpose
This document defines Swan Recruitment’s approach to **personal data retention and deletion** in compliance with GDPR and UK regulations.

## Scope
- Contractor and client records
- Timesheets & invoices
- Employment contracts
- Candidate applications (via CATSone ATS)
- Supporting system logs

## Principles
1. **Data Minimisation** – collect only what is needed for business/legal purposes.
2. **Transparency** – contractors are informed about data use at onboarding.
3. **Access Control** – data restricted to authorised Swan staff (4 members).
4. **Right to Erasure** – requests honoured within 30 days, unless legal retention overrides apply.

## Retention Rules
- **Timesheets & Invoices** – 7 years (UK tax & accounting law).
- **Contracts** – 7 years after assignment completion.
- **Candidate Applications** – 2 years if no placement; delete sooner on request.
- **System Logs** – 12 months for troubleshooting, then purged.
- **Email Correspondence** – aligned with contract/invoice retention, max 7 years.

## Backups
- Encrypted using AES-256.
- Geographically limited to UK/EU regions.
- Annual purge of expired backups.

## Review Cycle
- Annual policy review by Swan Recruitment management.
- Update if UK GDPR or HMRC record rules change.
