# üõ°Ô∏è PII Policy (Swan Systems)

**Purpose:** Define how personally identifiable information (PII) is handled across Portal, Backend, Finance, and Control Tower.

## Handling Rules
- **CT events must not contain direct PII.** Replace with hashes or references.
- **Storage of truth:** PII lives in Firestore secure collections or the finance system, not in CT payloads.
- **Mask for reports:** Where PII-derived business identifiers are needed (e.g., VAT), mask except for last two characters.
- **Access control:** Finance-only data is RBAC limited; logs never include PII values.
