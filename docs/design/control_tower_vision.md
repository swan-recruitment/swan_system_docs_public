**Location:** `docs/design/control_tower_vision.md`  
**Related:** [Work Order ‚Äì Control Tower](/swan_system_docs/docs/work-orders/work_order_control_tower.md) ‚Ä¢ [Phase Plans Index](../plans/phase_plans_index.md) ‚Ä¢ [Work Order Master](../work_order_master.md)

---

## 1) Executive Summary
The **Control Tower** is the command center for the Swan ERP. It provides **visibility, orchestration, governance, and intelligence** across all subsystems (Firebase backend, Contractor Portal, Website, Payments/Reconciliation, Desktop Manager, etc.).  
This document defines the **why**, **what**, and **how**, and lays out a **multi‚Äëphase roadmap** from MVP to intelligent automation.

**Goals**
- **Reliability:** Detect failures quickly; enable fast recovery.
- **Operability:** One place to observe jobs, systems, versions, and data flows.
- **Control:** Trigger/retry workflows safely with audit, approvals, and RBAC.
- **Insight:** Track KPIs across the contractor lifecycle; surface anomalies.
- **Evolution:** Grow from simple checks to predictive and prescriptive automation.

**Non‚ÄëGoals (for MVP)**
- Building a full BI platform (dashboards should be focused on operations, not full finance BI).
- Replacing subsystem UIs (Control Tower is orchestration first; UIs can come later).
- Storing long‚Äëterm system of record data (observe/coordinate rather than own).

---

## 2) Context & Personas
**Business context:** Lean recruitment operation delivering engineering talent, with workflows spanning **candidate ‚Üí contract ‚Üí timesheet ‚Üí invoice ‚Üí payment ‚Üí reporting**.

**Key personas**
- **Admin (Faye)** ‚Äì processes timesheets/invoices; needs status, quick retries, and confidence.
- **Ops (Ben)** ‚Äì oversees systems; needs health, metrics, change visibility, and overrides.
- **Client Liaison (Alex)** ‚Äì wants summaries/SLAs on delivery; limited, read‚Äëonly views.
- **Recruiter/Sales (Craig)** ‚Äì occasional visibility; limited, read‚Äëonly views.
- **Engineer/Developer** ‚Äì needs deep logs, deploy/version info, and diagnostics.

---

## 3) Requirements

### 3.1 Functional Requirements
1. **Health & Status**
   - Service health (Firebase, Portal, Website, Payments, Integrations).
   - Data‚Äëflow health (e.g., ‚Äúall expected timesheets received by Monday 10:00‚Äù).

2. **Workflow Orchestration**
   - Trigger and chain jobs (e.g., *Starter Flow ‚Üí Contract Gen ‚Üí CSV Export ‚Üí Drive Upload*).
   - Retry with context; backoff and idempotency.
   - Conditional branching (skip invoice if timesheet missing, etc.).

3. **Observability**
   - **Events & Runs:** each job run emits events (start, success, failure, metrics).
   - **Logs:** link to detailed logs (stored in subsystem or central store).
   - **Metrics/KPIs:** time‚Äëto‚Äëcontract, invoice cycle time, timesheet compliance rate, failure rates.

4. **Governance**
   - **RBAC** (Admin/Operator/Viewer) and least‚Äëprivilege access.
   - **Audit trail** for actions/changes (who/what/when/why/context).
   - **Change visibility:** show current versions/tags per repo; highlight drift from `main`.

5. **Notifications**
   - Slack/Email alerts for failures, SLO breaches, and daily digests.

6. **APIs**
   - REST API for health, runs, triggers, metrics, and configuration.

### 3.2 Non‚ÄëFunctional Requirements
- **Availability:** 99.5%+ (MVP) ‚Üí 99.9% (Phase 3).
- **Latency:** Health checks < 2s; trigger ack < 1s.
- **Security:** OAuth/JWT for UI/API; signed webhooks; encrypted secrets.
- **Compliance:** GDPR‚Äëaware logging; data retention & redaction policies.
- **Portability:** Local dev + cloud deploy; minimal vendor lock‚Äëin around orchestration.
- **Cost Awareness:** Prefer serverless/managed for MVP; scale only where needed.

## 5) Component Detail

### 5.1 API (FastAPI)
- **Endpoints** (draft):
  - `GET /health` ‚Äì CT self‚Äëhealth.
  - `GET /health/subsystems` ‚Äì Firebase, Portal, Payments, Website.
  - `POST /triggers/{job}` ‚Äì run a job (payload includes parameters, reason, correlationId).
  - `GET /runs` / `GET /runs/{id}` ‚Äì list run history / details.
  - `GET /metrics/kpi` ‚Äì KPI snapshot (contract time, invoice cycle, etc.).
  - `GET /versions` ‚Äì versions/tags per repo; drift indicator.
- **Auth** via OAuth/JWT; **Scopes**: `ct.viewer`, `ct.operator`, `ct.admin`.
- **Rate limits** and idempotency keys for triggers.

### 5.2 Scheduler / Orchestrator
- Run book definitions in code (Python) with **idempotent steps**.
- **Chaining:** DAG‚Äëlike execution with success/failed branches.
- **Retries:** exponential backoff, max attempts, dead‚Äëletter capture.
- **Time windows:** e.g., timesheet completeness window closes Monday 10:00.

### 5.3 Observability Collector
- **Event model:** `{ts, subsystem, job, runId, level, msg, meta}`.
- **Aggregation:** last‚Äërun status, rolling failure rate, duration histograms.
- **SLO evaluator:** compares metrics to SLO targets, emits alerts.

### 5.4 RBAC & Audit
- **Roles:** Viewer (read‚Äëonly), Operator (triggers), Admin (config).
- **Audit events:** `{ts, actor, action, resource, result, reason, diff}`.
- **Approvals:** optional 2‚Äëstep approval for high‚Äëimpact jobs.

### 5.5 Config & Secrets
- **Config hierarchy:** default ‚Üí env ‚Üí secret overrides.
- **Secret storage:** OS env vars in dev; Secret Manager/Vault in prod.

## 6) Representative Flows

### 6.1 Starter Flow ‚Äì Retry with Context
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  autonumber
  participant U as Operator (Ben/Faye)
  participant CT as Control Tower API
  participant OR as Orchestrator
  participant FB as Firebase Backend
  U->>CT: POST /triggers/starter-flow {contractorId, reason}
  CT->>OR: enqueue(job="starter-flow", ctx)
  OR->>FB: POST /api/starter-flow {contractorId}
  FB-->>OR: 500 error (missing field)
  OR->>CT: emit failure event + logs
  U->>CT: GET /runs/{id} (view error context)
  U->>CT: POST /triggers/starter-flow {contractorId, fix=fieldX}
  OR->>FB: POST /api/starter-flow {contractorId, fix=fieldX}
  FB-->>OR: 200 OK (contract docs generated)
  OR-->>CT: emit success; update KPIs
```

### 6.2 Timesheet Completeness Gate
- Window closes Monday 10:00 (Europe/London).
- If missing timesheets > threshold ‚Üí alert Admin; skip invoice generation; open task.

---

## 7) KPIs, SLOs & Error Budgets

### 7.1 Operational KPIs
- **Contract generation lead time** (payload received ‚Üí docs generated).
- **Invoice cycle time** (timesheet accepted ‚Üí invoice issued).
- **Timesheet compliance rate** (% weeks with complete submissions by deadline).
- **Job failure rate** (per subsystem, rolling 7d/30d).

### 7.2 SLOs (MVP Targets)
- **Job success rate:** ‚â• 98% / 30d.
- **Time to detect failure:** ‚â§ 5 min (alerts).
- **Time to recover (MTTR):** P50 ‚â§ 15 min, P95 ‚â§ 60 min.

### 7.3 Error Budget
- Allocate acceptable failure minutes per month; halt risky releases when exhausted.

---

## 8) Notifications & Escalation
- **Channels:** Slack and Email (configurable).
- **Policies:** 
  - Immediate: job failure, health down, SLO breach.
  - Digest: daily summary (runs, failures, top KPIs).
- **Escalation:** If unresolved after N hours ‚Üí escalate to Director.

---

## 9) Security, Privacy, Compliance
- **AuthN/Z:** OAuth/JWT + RBAC; signed webhooks for inbound.
- **PII Handling:** minimize; redact logs; avoid storing PII in Events.
- **Data Retention:** see ¬ß5.6; export aged data to cold storage.
- **Approvals:** admin‚Äëgated triggers for finance‚Äëimpacting jobs.
- **Backups:** daily state backup; tested restore procedure.

---

## 10) Environments & Deployment
- **Envs:** `dev` (local), `staging`, `prod`.
- **CI/CD:** PR checks (lint, tests), version bump, changelog, deploy on tag.
- **Config per env:** endpoints, secrets, alert routes.
- **Rollbacks:** previous tag redeploy; maintain infra as code (IaC optional).

---

## 11) Versioning & Repo Visibility
- **Track** versions for `swan-control-tower`, `swan-firebase-backend`, `swan-contractor-portal`, `swan-website`, etc.
- **Drift indicator:** behind/ahead relative to target branch (`main` or `prod`).
