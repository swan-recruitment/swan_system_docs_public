**Last updated:** 2025-09-27  

---

## 0) Why this document exists
You already have execution‚Äëready Work Orders (WOs) for each subsystem. This **FULL** Master Work Order ties them to **business outcomes**, sets **program KPIs**, enforces **governance & compliance**, and lays out **dependency, capacity, and escalation** models so delivery stays predictable as Swan scales.

---

## 1) Strategic Alignment ‚Üí Business Outcomes
| Subsystem | Strategic Purpose | Primary Outcome | Secondary Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| Contractor Portal | Digitise contractor interactions (onboarding, uploads, status) | Faster onboarding; fewer manual touches | Better data quality for invoicing |
| Firebase Backend | Single source of truth + workflow engine | Reliable contract/timesheet lifecycle | Lower maintenance via serverless |
| Website | Lead capture & credibility | More qualified leads | Lower pre‚Äësales time |
| Finance Integration | Invoice export, payment ingest | Accurate, timely invoicing | Improved cash flow |
| Desktop Manager | Safe local orchestration for staff | Repeatable operations | Fewer production credentials needed |
| Control Tower | Visibility + orchestration + audit | Reduced downtime; faster recovery | Operational metrics & SLOs |
| Excel Migration | De‚Äërisk legacy, unify processes | Eliminate double entry | Audit trail over e‚Äëmail/Excel |
| Visuals & Docs | Shared mental model & standards | Faster onboarding | Fewer architectural regressions |

**Strategic goals (2025‚Äì2026):** shorten lead‚Üícontract time, reduce invoice cycle time, increase operational reliability (measured via CT SLOs).

---

## 2) Program KPIs (targets & measurement)
| KPI | Target | Measured by | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Contractor onboarding time | ‚Üì 50% vs legacy | Portal events + CT | From document receipt to ‚ÄúReady to bill‚Äù |
| Timesheet‚ÜíInvoice accuracy | ‚â• 99% | Finance export validations | Parallel run during migration |
| Invoice cycle time (issue‚Üípaid) | ‚â§ 14 days median | Finance events + CT | Tracked as rolling 30d |
| CT event coverage | ‚â• 90% of key flows | CT events/type vs expected | Gaps logged as backlog items |
| CI pass rate (protected branches) | ‚â• 85% | GitHub Actions | Signals quality gates working |
| Docs link health | 0 broken for 30 consecutive days | Link‚Äëcheck CI | ‚ÄúGreen bar‚Äù policy |

> KPIs are reviewed monthly in the governance audit; changes require Owner approval.

## 3) Governance Framework (people, rules, lifecycle)

### 3.1 Roles
- **Owner**: Benjamin Ian Pitman ‚Äî program lead & architect.

- **Contributors**: engineers/contractors/assistants assigned per WO.

### 3.2 RACI (example ‚Äî Finance Integration)
- **R**: Engineer implementing export/payment ingest  
- **A**: Ben  
- **C**: Alex (finance semantics), Faye (invoice ops)  
- **I**: Craig (upstream workflow visibility)

### 3.3 Change Control
1) PR with WO change ‚Üí 2) Reviewer sign‚Äëoff ‚Üí 3) Owner approves ‚Üí 4) Archive snapshot in `docs/work_orders/archive/`.

### 3.4 Lifecycle States
`Draft` ‚Üí `In Progress` ‚Üí `Complete` ‚Üí `Archived`  
- Archived WOs stay indexed with üîí tag + date; links must continue to resolve.

### 3.5 Documentation Rules
- Each WO must: **(a)** link back to this Master, **(b)** declare Owner & Status, **(c)** include Acceptance Criteria & Risks, **(d)** reference relevant Visuals.  
- `work_orders_index.md` is authoritative for status/owner/last updated.

**Dependencies:** P3 complete.

### Phase 5 ‚Äî Data & Insights (future)
**Objectives:** CT analytics views, trend reports, management pack.  
**Exit:** automated monthly ‚ÄúOps Pack‚Äù published from CT data.

### Phase 6 ‚Äî Resilience & Scale (future)
**Objectives:** disaster recovery, multi‚Äëregion posture, performance hardening.  
**Exit:** DR test passes; p95 intake latency < 2m sustained.

## 5) Dependency Mapping (blocking vs soft)

**Blocking dependencies (must complete first):**
- Excel Migration validation ‚Üí Finance Integration go‚Äëlive.  
- Finance v1 live ‚Üí CT triggers that depend on finance data.  
- Backend schemas baseline ‚Üí Portal/Website feature parity.

**Soft dependencies (parallel ok, cross‚Äëlink later):**
- Visuals updates ‚Üî active WOs.  
- CT UI scaffold ‚Üî CT API (can trail by one phase).

See diagram: `docs/design/visuals/master_dependencies.mmd`.

## 6) Resource & Capacity Planning (lightweight)
| WO | Owner | Reviewers | Est. Effort | Window | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Firebase Backend | Ben | Craig | 2‚Äì3 wks | P1 | Schemas + workflows |
| Contractor Portal | Ben | Craig | 2‚Äì4 wks | P1‚ÄìP2 | Uploads/UX loops |
| Finance Integration | Alex (impl via eng) | Faye | 3‚Äì5 wks | P2 | Export + payment ingest |
| Excel Migration | Ben | Faye | 1‚Äì2 wks | P2 | Parallel run & diffs |
| Control Tower | Ben | Alex | 3‚Äì5 wks | P3 | Ingest, runs, digest |
| Desktop Manager | Ben | Alex | 1‚Äì2 wks | P3 | Triggers + views |
| Website | Ben | Alex | 1‚Äì2 wks | P2 | Lead capture |
| Visuals & Docs | Ben | ‚Äî | Ongoing | P1‚ÄìP4 | Diagrams & indices |

> If the same person is on multiple critical items, time‚Äëslice: 60/20/20 across priorities, or defer non‚Äëblocking work to the next phase.

---

## 7) Escalation & Decision Rights
- **Severity P0** (prod outage, blocked invoicing): escalate to **Owner** immediately; notify Alex for client impact.  
- **Severity P1** (major degradation, risky data mismatch): Owner + relevant Reviewer within 4 business hours.  
- **Severity P2/P3**: track in backlog and address in next sprint/phase.  
- **Decision rights:** Owner is final tie‚Äëbreaker after Reviewer input.

---

## 8) Compliance & Auditability (pragmatic)
- **Traceability**: every invoice must be linkable to timesheets & approvals (IDs in events & runs).  
- **Data protection**: redact PII in CT events; store documents in Storage with controlled ACLs.  
- **Retention**: events 180d, runs 365d, systems 90d; backups daily.  
- **Access**: principle of least privilege; service tokens rotated quarterly.  
- **Evidence**: preserve daily digests and CI logs for audit trails.

---

## 9) Communication & Reporting
- **Weekly**: short status note (what shipped, risks, blockers).  
- **Monthly**: governance audit (KPIs vs targets, link health, schema drift).  
- **Quarterly**: board review + archived snapshot + roadmap refresh.  
- **CT Digest**: 08:00 Europe/London daily roll‚Äëup for operations.

---

## 10) Backlog Integration
- All unresolved work funnels to **`docs/tasks/backlog.md`**.  
- Each WO should carry its own TODOs, but canonical planning happens in the backlog.  
- No WO closes with open critical TODOs unless explicitly deferred in backlog.

---

## 11) Quality Gates & Automation
- **Docs**: link‚Äëcheck CI must pass; visuals exported; backlinks present.  
- **APIs**: OpenAPI (Spectral lint) ‚Äî tracked in backlog to implement CI step.  
- **Code**: unit/functional tests on PR; protected branches require passing checks.  
- **CT**: HMAC verification, idempotency, DLQ with replay audit (once implemented).

---

## 12) Risk Register (expanded)
| Risk | L | I | Owner | Mitigation |
|---|:--:|:--:|---|---|
| Schema drift across repos | M | H | Ben | Central schemas + CI validation |
| Invoice export mismatch | M | H | Alex | Parallel run, diff reports, sign‚Äëoff |
| Alert fatigue in CT | M | M | Ben | Thresholds, dedupe, digest for low‚Äëprio |
| Resource contention (single‚Äëthreaded) | H | M | Ben | Time‚Äëslicing; sequence blocking work |
| Broken links in docs | M | M | Ben | Link‚Äëcheck CI; quarterly audit |
| Secrets leakage | L | H | Ben | Secret manager, rotation, scope reduction |
